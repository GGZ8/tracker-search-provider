tracker-search-provider
=======================

Gnome-shell extension: displays tracker search results in the shell overview


__Description__
This extension is derived from https://github.com/cewee/tracker-search.
Since it looks like it was aandoned, I completely refactored it to work again in gnome-shell 3.10 onward.



__Installation__
To install, simply copy the 3 files into a directory '~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/tracker-search-provider@sinnix.de'
(the directory 'tracker-search-provider@sinnix.de' has to be created first).
Then reload your shell (you can also logout/login) and acitvate it with gnome-tweak-tool or the extensions website.



Please feel free to contribute (especially for displaying the results itself)
